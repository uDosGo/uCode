| [NetHack](nethack/) | Adapt C source → BBC BASIC | Medium | 3 | ✅ Research + 52-line skeleton |
| [Repton](repton/) | Adapt 6502 source + clones | Small | 2 | ✅ Pipeline done, 275-line playable level 1 |
| [Knight Orc](knight-orc/) | Rewrite (inspired by KAOS engine) | Large | 10 | ✅ GDD + 64-line skeleton |
| [Apple Panic](apple-panic/) | Rewrite (inspired by Space Panic) | Small | 2 | ✅ GDD + 281-line skeleton |
| [uConstruct](uconstruct/) | Rewrite (inspired by ACS, 1984) | Large | 10 | ✅ Scaffold + 49-line skeleton |
| [Eamon](eamon/) | Adapt Applesoft BASIC source | Medium | 3 | ✅ Research + 63-line skeleton |

## Program Structure

Each program follows the canonical layout:

```

├── src/                  # Source code (BBC BASIC, 6502 ASM, etc.)
├── assets/
│   ├── sprites/          # Character/sprite assets

└── test/                 # Integration tests
```

## Build Order

1. **Repton** ✅ Pipeline complete, playable level 1
2. **Apple Panic** ✅ BBC BASIC skeleton with digging/trapping
3. **Eamon** ✅ Research done, BBC BASIC skeleton generated
4. **Elite** ✅ Pipeline complete, station economy + flight loop
5. **NetHack** ✅ Research done, BBC BASIC skeleton generated
6. **uConstruct** ✅ Scaffold done, BBC BASIC skeleton generated
7. **Knight Orc** ✅ GDD + BBC BASIC skeleton generated

All 7 programs now have BBC BASIC skeletons via the Skills Framework pipeline.
