# uCode Repository Boundary

> **uCode is not an app GUI repo. It is the runtime/algebra/code-delivery layer.**
> It provides render targets/widgets for inspection, but it should not own the full product UI.

## Core Identity

uCode is a self-contained runtime, grid algebra, and code-delivery repo for
uDosGo code surfaces. It is designed to be consumed by host applications such as
uCore **without requiring those hosts to own uCode internals**.

uCode is **not** a full application GUI. It provides:

- Runtime packages
- Grid/code algebra
- Import/export tooling
- CLI/MCP surfaces
- Inspectable render targets (terminal & teletext widgets)

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |

| `tests/`                     | Integration tests                                      |

### uCode Does NOT Own

- Full uCore developer GUI
- Product shell/navigation
- User account/session app frame
- Dashboard orchestration
- Long-running command centre
- Application routing

These belong to host applications (e.g., uCore).

## Architecture

```
uCore / host app
    |
    | consumes (packages, CLI, MCP, artifacts)
    v
uCode
    |
    | exposes
    v
Runtime + algebra + widgets + CLI/MCP
    |
    | renders/inspects through
    v
TerminalWidget / TeletextWidget / TerminalUI
```

More concretely:

```
uCore owns:
  - app shell
  - routes
  - project/workspace management
  - user-facing developer view
  - orchestration UI
  - snackbar daemon
  - Hivemind MCP server
  - Ollama lifecycle management

uCode owns:
  - code/runtime model
  - grid algebra
  - runtime package format
  - BASIC/AMOS bridges
  - GridSmith agent
  - CLI
  - MCP tools
  - terminal/teletext render surfaces
```

## Render Surface Contract

`TerminalWidget`, `TeletextWidget`, and `TerminalUI` are **inspectors, preview
surfaces, debug views, and runtime output views** — not the main application.

They should:

- Accept a `Grid` and render it
- Be embeddable in host app views
- Be packageable and importable from host apps
- Never assume they are the full application shell

## Package Boundaries

### Export Paths

```typescript
// Host apps consume uCode packages via:
import { ... } from '@udos/gridcore'
import { TerminalWidget, TeletextWidget } from '@udos/viewport-renderer'
import { GridSmith } from '@udos/gridsmith'
```

### Dependency Direction

```
@udos/gridcore          ← no uCode-internal dependencies
@udos/viewport-renderer → depends on @udos/gridcore
@udos/gridsmith         → depends on @udos/gridcore, @udos/viewport-renderer
```

No package should depend on uCore or any host application.

## Development Rule

> **uCode must be installable, buildable, testable, and packageable from this
> repo alone. It must not depend on implementation code from uCore.**

## AI Integration Surface

uCode provides MCP tooling (via GridSmith) that can be consumed by AI agents.
For full AI provider routing (Ollama, OpenRouter, Hivemind), uCode delegates to
uCore's snackbar daemon:

```
GridSmith MCP  →  uCore Snackbar (port 8484)  →  LiteLLM → Ollama/OpenRouter
```

Configuration for this lives in:

- `config/hivemind.env` — API keys
- `config/openrouter.yaml` — Model routing tiers
- `config/mcp_config.json` — MCP server definitions
- `config/vault.yaml` — Vault/secret paths
